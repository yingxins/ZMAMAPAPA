ZMAP (Zebrafish Multi-study Atlas Project) is a harmonized single-cell RNA sequencing reference atlas for zebrafish embryogenesis, enabling robust cross-study comparison of cell identities.
ZMAP integrates eight published datasets comprising over 790,000 cells spanning 15 developmental time windows from gastrulation through larval stages with a curated hierarchical cell ontology from germ layer to high-resolution clusters. 
Through an interactive web portal, you can explore 2D and 3D UMAP embeddings, query high resolution gene expression, access to the consensus marker resources and project your dataset on it rapidly.
