ZMAP (Zebrafish Multi-study Atlas Project) is a harmonized single-cell RNA sequencing reference atlas for zebrafish embryogenesis, enabling robust cross-study comparison of cell identities.
ZMAP integrates eight published datasets comprising over 790,000 cells spanning 15 developmental time windows from gastrulation through larval stages with a curated hierarchical cell ontology from germ layer to high-resolution clusters. 
Through an interactive web portal, you can explore 2D and 3D UMAP embeddings, query genes, access to the consensus marker resources and project your dataset on it rapidly.
